# GoTrip Backend Agent Instruction

GoTrip is a NestJS GraphQL monorepo migrated from Real estate platform into a
Travel Tour Booking Platform

## Read First

Before changing code, read the current AI handoff docs:

- `docs/ai/BACKEND_MIGRATION.md`
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/ai/COMPLETED_TASKS.md`
- `docs/ai/NEXT_STEPS.md`

Use those files as the source of truth for AI Agent related migration history, accepted decisions, remaining work and validation status.

## Project Shape

- Backend apps are `gotrip-api` and `gotrip-batch`.
- Keep the existing NestJS resolver/service/module pattern based on MVC and DI.
- Keep DTOs, enums, schemas under `apps/gotrip-api/src/libs`.
- Keep shared modules reusable: auth, member, like, view, comment, follow, board article, socket.

## Domain Rules

- Use GoTrip/tour terminology for the main catalog entity.
- Do not reintroduce property or real-estate fields.
- Keep `MemberType.USER`, `MemberType.AGENT` and `MemberType.ADMIN` unchanged.
- Tour ownership continues to use `MemberType.AGENT` unless a later migration explicitly changes it.
- Tour enum values are:
  - `tourCategory`: `ADVENTURE`, `CULTURAL`, `HISTORICAL`, `BEACH`, `MOUNTAIN`, `CITY`, `CRUISE`
  - `tourStatus`: `ACTIVE`, `SOLD_OUT`, `PAUSED`, `DELETED`
- Booking, payment, wishlist, destination, and tour-schedule modules are out of scope. Do not reintroduce them without an explicit decision.
- Saved tours use likes (`likeTargetTour`, `getFavoriteTours`), not a wishlist module.

## Workflow

1. Analyze before editing.
2. Keep changes small and consistent with existing project patterns.
3. Do not remove working logic unless it is replaced safely.
4. Update `docs/ai/COMPLETED_TASKS.md` after major completed work.
5. Add or update focused tests when behavior changes.

## Validation

Use these checks for backend work:

```bash
npx tsc -p apps/gotrip-api/tsconfig.app.json --noEmit
npx tsc -p apps/gotrip-batch/tsconfig.app.json --noEmit
npm run build
```

`npm run lint` runs ESLint with `--fix`, so use it only when file rewriting is acceptable.
